# AEGIS: Autonomous Irrigation Controller for Frost Damage Prevention

This project implements an autonomous irrigation controller designed to prevent frost damage on citrus trees using undertree microsprinklers. 
The system monitors environmental conditions and activates the irrigation system when frost risk is detected.

## Hardware Components

- Raspberry Pi 3/4 Model B
- ~~BME280 Sensor (Temperature, Humidity, Pressure)~~
- SHT40 Sensor (Temperature, Humidity)
- 5V Power Supply
- Solid State Relay

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of temperature and humidity
- Automated activation of irrigation system based on temperature drop and frost risk
- Data logging for analysis
